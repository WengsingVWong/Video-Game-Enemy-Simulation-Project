# Video Game Enemy Simulation Project
This was the final project for my Object-Oriented Programming II (CIS 4100) class at Baruch College (CUNY). You can find the instructions for the project [here](https://github.com/WengsingVWong/Video-Game-Enemy-Simulation-Project/Final%20Project_Fall20) (I've also included the PDF file within this repository as well).
