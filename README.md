# Video Game Enemy Simulation Project
This was the final project for my Object-Oriented Programming II (CIS 4100) class at Baruch College (CUNY).

I designed an abstract Enemy parent class and three EnemyType subclasses (animal, military aircraft, humanoid). The parent class contains three public virtual functions that are redefined in each subclass and represent the actions an Enemy can perform. In the main file, I create an array of Enemy objects and endlessly simulate their behavior (until the user tells the program to stop). Each class has separate specification and implementation files. For more details, you can find the project instructions [here](Final%20Project_Fall20.pdf) (I've included the PDF file within this repository as well).

## What You'll Need
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is sufficient)
